This file contains a bunch of short snippets that were too short to be a
snippet of their own.

loop.c     - Kill the MUD if it goes into an endless loop [1]
lastcomm.c - Save the last command before a crash

stdarg.c   - printf_to_char, bugf, logf - variable arguments


NOTES:

lastcomm.c: Since I posted the code to merc-l, I changed
nasty_signal_handler() to return rather than abort(): this produces a better
stack.

[1] This file used to be named deadlock.c, but it has nothing to do with a
deadlock.
