Changes since v6
----------------

Fixed a security problem: make sure that in do_copyover you disconnect
*all* characters that are not currently in the game.

Changes since v5
----------------

Added instructions for Smaug 1.4, submitted by callidyrr-is@home.com
(http://tgki.cjb.net/)

Chance since v4
---------------

The COPYOVER_FILE was never closed in copyover_recover. Thanks to Jessica
Boyd <enigma@ns1.inland.net> for finding this problem.

Now a Circle patch is available. Thanks for Dan Stagner and Chris Bagget to
testing it and finding the bug :)


Changes since v3
----------------

Added Walter Goodwin's patch for Smaug. Moved the files to an archive.

Changes since v2
----------------

To check if someone is playing, the do_copyover checked if their connected
states is 0 or less. In my setup, I have states that are logging in as
negative, playing as 0, and note-writing and such states (which should not
be freed when losink link) as positive.

Changes since v1
----------------

ROM 2.4(b2 I think?) diff is now included, at the end of this file. I took a
slightly modified ROM 2.4 source I had (I did not alas save the original) -
with objdump/mobprogs, and added copyover, tested then created a diff.
Export the last part of this file where the patch is, the apply with the
'patch' program. It may fail, then you have to apply the patch by hand.

I assume you know what the patch program is or if not, are smart enough to
figure out how to find it. I also assume at least intermediate C knowledge:
if you are confused by a "parse error" then you shouldn't be installing this
patch, you should be reading a book about 'C'.
