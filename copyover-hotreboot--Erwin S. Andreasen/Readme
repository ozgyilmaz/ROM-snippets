Copyover - "hot reboot"
=======================

by Erwin S. Andreasen <erwin@andreasen.org> - http://pip.dknet.dk/~erwin/


Here is a version of the "hot reboot" command that logs in the players after 
the reboot is finished. It was inspired by the discussion about how MUD++ did
this, but it does not base itself on MUD++'s code.

Basically, for each playing descriptor, it saves the descriptor number,
the player's original name as well as the host name (so we don't have to find
that again).

Then, it closes fpReserve, and exec's the MUD again. As exec preserves
open file descriptors, players do not lose link. The MUD is executed with
some extra parameters, so the new copy knows that it should reload some
player files. It does that, and puts in the players at their old places.

This has been somewhat tested with Envy 2.0. For ROM users, there may be
changes. Pets, for one - I just move the characters to the room, but as far as
I remember, ROM also saves pets. There should be no problems with MERC.

For Circle, only 3.0pl11 (10?) was tested.

You will need to add do_copyover to some fitting file, and change a bit in
db.c as well as comm.c.

You will also need to add/change the prototypes for the various functions.
If you do not know how to do this, you should do this at all :)


KNOWN PROBLEMS:

This is just like a normal reboot, except that players are logged in afterwards
automatically. So, corpses and disarmed weapons disappear. Aggressive monsters
reappear - so you might want to give your players some warning.

If your MUD does not crash, and you never reboot but just use copyover, you
will have one big log file. A solution is to let the MUD, not the startup
script figure out a log file name. To allow output from perror() which goes
to stderr to get there too, you could dup2 the new file to stderr and
keep writing to stderr. I plan on making one log file for each day, and write
only the time of the day in the log file, saving some space.

Output buffer flushing - My log_string() does a fflush(stderr) each time it
is used. I am not sure it is necessary, but you might add one too, just
before the execl() if you are losing some of the log file before the
copyover.

Also remember that any send_to_char() that you use just before the
do_copyover() will not get through, as they are buffered and not sent
until all commands are completed. 


CREDITS:

This was inspired by the merc-l discussion of how Fusion's MUD++ did just the 
same thing, although I did not use any of MUD++'s code. If you use this 
command, mail me, as well as add my name in your help entry. You are also
required just to take at least a brief look at ftp://ftp.pip.dknet.dk ,
in the /pub/pip1773 directory for my other improvements to MERC/Envy/ROM
code :)
